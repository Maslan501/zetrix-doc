# Overview of Zetrix

## What is Zetrix

Zetrix is a next-generation layer-1 public blockchain engineered to power enterprise and government-grade decentralised applications (dApps). Designed with scalability, interoperability, and regulatory compliance at its core, Zetrix aspires to serve as a foundational platform for cross-border digital services and digital asset ecosystems.

As a public blockchain infrastructure, Zetrix facilitates the secure and efficient transfer of value, analogous to how the internet enables the free flow of information. It is specifically tailored to address real-world enterprise challenges such as:

* Interoperability between different blockchain networks
* Digital identity and verifiable credentials
* Cross-chain data exchange

Additionally, Zetrix is aligned with emerging global digital trade frameworks, making it a strategic enabler for next-generation digital commerce.

## Consensus Mechanism

Technically, Zetrix leverages a hybrid consensus mechanism that combines Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) and Zetrix Byzantine Fault Tolerance (zBFT). This approach delivers rapid block finality, scalability, and robust security. With a current throughput of 2,000 transactions per second (TPS) and theoretical scalability to 10,000 TPS through sharding and subchains, Zetrix is designed for high-performance applications.

Smart contracts on Zetrix are written in JavaScript and supported by an integrated web-based IDE, enabling developers to build, test, and deploy seamlessly.

A key differentiator of Zetrix is its cross-chain and cross-border focus. It is interoperable with other blockchain ecosystems like Ethereum, Hyperledger, and Astron through inter-chain protocols. Additionally, it is integrated with Xinghuo BIF, China’s national blockchain infrastructure, via MYEG’s international supernodes. This positions Zetrix as a digital bridge between Southeast Asia and China, particularly under the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) initiative, making it a vital infrastructure for regional digital trade and digital ID applications.

Based on the DPoS mechanism, ordinary nodes stake ZETRIX tokens to join the validating node-set. From this set, 21 validating nodes are randomly selected in a cyclical rotation to generate blocks using the zBFT algorithm. Validators are elected via a validator contract, enabling the chain to maintain high transaction speeds while ensuring decentralisation and security.

## Zetrix Currency Unit

The currency unit of Zetrix is called Zetrix, represented as "ZETRIX". For example, both "1 Zetrix" and "1 ZETRIX" are valid expressions.

Zetrix is subdivided into smaller units, with the smallest possible unit named Zeta.\
The conversion rate is:

> **1 ZETRIX = 1,000,000 Zeta**

This micro-denomination allows for high-precision transactions and fine-grained asset management within the Zetrix ecosystem.

|  ZETRIX  |    Zeta   |
| :------: | :-------: |
|     1    | 1,000,000 |
| 0.000001 |     1     |
