**2. Introduction to Development**

Zetrix provides an easy-to-use Integrated Development Environment (IDE) at [ide.zetrix.com](https://ide.zetrix.com/),              allowing developers to quickly start building and deploying smart contracts on the Zetrix blockchain. This section will guide you through setting up your development environment, writing smart contracts, and interacting with the Zetrix blockchain using the IDE.

**2.1 Setting Up Development Environment**

The Zetrix IDE is a web-based platform, so there's no need for extensive local setup. To get started, follow these simple steps:

**Steps:**

1. **Visit** [**ide.zetrix.com**](https://ide.zetrix.com/): Open your web browser and navigate to the IDE.
2. **Create an Account or Sign In**: If you are a new user, create an account by registering with your email. If you already have an account, log in.
3. **Connect to Zetrix Testnet**: The IDE automatically connects to the Zetrix testnet for development and testing purposes. You can switch to the mainnet when you're ready to deploy live contracts.
4. **Access Developer Tools**: The IDE provides a fully integrated suite of tools, including javascript contract editor and a interface development environment for deploying contracts to the Zetrix blockchain.
