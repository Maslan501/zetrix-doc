# Key Concept

* **Flexible Account Structure**\
  Supports accounts with multiple assets and multiple operators, making complex setups easy to manage.
* **Dual-Layer Consensus called "Firework"** \
  Uses a two-step system (DPoS + BFT) to process transactions quickly and securely.
* **Multi-Chain System called "Orbits"**\
  Allows many sub-chains to run under a main chain, boosting performance and scalability.
* **Cross-Chain Network called "Canal"** \
  Enables smooth transfer of data and assets between different blockchains.
* **Powerful Smart Contracts**\
  Supports full programming capabilities using JavaScript for building dApps.
* **Multiple Signature Options**\
  Includes strong cryptographic support like ED25519 and SM2 for secure digital signatures.
* **Multi-Signature Accounts**\
  Allows accounts to require approvals from multiple users for extra security.
* **High-Speed Transactions**\
  Can handle thousands of transactions per second, making it suitable for large-scale use.
* **Runs on All Major Platforms**\
  Compatible with Linux, Windows, macOS, and Android for flexible deployment.
* **Built-in Privacy Protection**\
  Uses advanced cryptography like zero-knowledge proofs to keep user data and transactions private.
