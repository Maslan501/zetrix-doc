# ZCert Issuer Platform

The **ZCert Issuer Platform** provides a structured and secure environment for organizations to manage **Verifiable Credential (VC)** components, specifically **VC Templates** and **Design Passes**. The platform assigns clear responsibilities and approval workflows based on user roles to ensure quality, governance, and consistency across issued credentials.

### **User Roles in the ZCert Issuer Platform**

The platform supports two primary roles:

#### **Issuer Admin**

* Holds the highest authority within the Issuer’s organization.
* Manages templates, design passes, and approvals.
* Oversees makers (sub-issuers) and validates their submissions.

#### **Maker (Sub-Issuer)**

* Responsible for preparing templates and design passes.
* Requires approval from the appropriate authority before templates or designs can be used.

### Understanding Templates and Design Passes

#### VC Template (Mandatory)

A **VC Template** defines the **core data schema** and **required fields** used during VC issuance.\
It is the essential component for creating Verifiable Credentials.

* Contains the key-value structure, rules, and metadata for the credential.
* Used directly by the VC Issuance API and issuance console.
* Must exist before any credential can be issued.

Example of VC template:&#x20;

```json
{
    "templateType": "MYKAD",
    "data": {
            "name": "Ali bin Abuq",
            "dob": "1990-01-01",
            "gender": "Male",
            "nationality": "Malaysian",
            "mykadNo": "901231-14-5678",
            "citizenType": "Warganegara",
            "address": "No. 123, Jalan Merdeka",
            "postcode": "43000",
            "city": "Kajang",
            "state": "Selangor",
            "photo": "base64-photo-string",
            "securityImage": "base64-security-image"
            }
} 

```

#### Design Pass (Optional)

A **Design Pass** is the **visual representation** of the credential, generated by combining:

* The VC Template (data structure), and
* A custom design layout (visual appearance)

Design passes function like **digital cards**, similar to how a digital passport, MyKad, or membership card visually displays the credential data.

* Enhances user experience by providing a branded, readable, card like UI.
* Completely optional  VCs can be issued without a design pass.

### Template Creation Workflow

#### **By Issuer Admin**

* Issuer Admin can create a template directly.
* **No approval is required.**\
  Once created, the template is immediately available for VC issuance.

#### **By Maker (Sub-Issuer)**

* Maker can create a template draft.
* The draft requires **Issuer Admin approval** before it becomes active.
* Ensures organizational governance and data schema integrity.

### Design Pass Workflow

Because design passes reflect the Issuer’s official visual identity, the platform enforces a stricter control mechanism.

#### **Approval Requirement**

* **All design passes whether created by Issuer Admin or Maker require Superadmin approval.**
* This ensures visual quality, branding consistency, and adherence to display standards.

#### **Design Pass Lifecycle**

1. **Creation**\
   Maker or Issuer Admin creates a design pass and maps it to the VC Template.
2. **Pending Approval**\
   The design pass enters the **‘Pending Approval’** state.
3. **Superadmin Review**\
   The Superadmin validates layout quality, readability, branding, and schema alignment.
4. **Approval or Rejection**\
   Only after approval can the design pass be used to generate digital card visuals during VC issuance.

### Template and Design Status Indicators

#### **Template Status: “Pending Design”**

After the Issuer Admin successfully creates a template:

* The system marks the template as **“Pending Design”**.
* At this stage, the template is **fully usable** for VC issuance even without a design pass.

This allows Issuers to:

* Start issuing VCs immediately using the template’s data schema.
* Optionally create a design pass later to support visual rendering.

#### **Design Pass Status: “Pending Approval”**

Once a design pass is created:

* Status changes to **“Pending Approval”**.
* The ZID Superadmin must validate the design before it can be used.
* Ensures the final appearance meets quality and compliance requirements.

### Onboarding to VC

All onboarding steps should first be performed on the **Testnet environment** for testing, and once validated, the same steps can be applied on **Mainnet** for production use:

* **Testnet**: [https://zid-issuer-sandbox.zetrix.com/#/](https://zid-issuer-sandbox.zetrix.com/#/)
* **Mainnet**: [https://zid-issuer.zetrix.com/#/](https://zid-issuer.zetrix.com/#/)



1. Log in using the Zetrix wallet at website to register and manage VC template.\
   **Note:** Developers may also create a template directly via the API.
2.  Fill in the company information and submit the application form.

3.  Once approved, the **Client** can create and manage a VC template as shown below.

4. After the VC template is submitted, it will shown in dashboard.
