# Zetrix MCP Server

The **Zetrix MCP Server** enables developers to build, test, and interact with blockchain applications using natural language conversations with AI assistants such as Claude. Instead of manually navigating RPC endpoints, writing boilerplate scripts, or switching tools, developers can simply _ask_ the AI to perform actions such as querying account balances, generating smart contracts, monitoring blockchain activity, or signing transactions.

This is made possible through the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, which acts as a bridge between AI tools and the Zetrix blockchain. With the Zetrix MCP Server, every aspect of Zetrix development becomes conversational, automated, and accessible.

This creates an **AI-assisted blockchain development environment**, enabling natural-language-driven workflows without manually referencing RPC documentation or switching between tools.
