# Multisig Dapp

The Zetrix Multisig DApp is a secure blockchain application that enables **joint account ownership** with **multiple required signatures (multisig)** before any transaction can be executed. Instead of one person holding full control, the system distributes authority among several trusted participants.

This improves:

* **Security** → Prevents unauthorized movements
* **Governance** → Decisions require agreement
* **Accountability** → Transparent approvals and history
* **Reliability** → Eliminates single points of failure

Typical Use Cases

* Corporate treasury management
* Shared project funds
* DAO governance execution
* Secure long-term storage
* High-value account protection
