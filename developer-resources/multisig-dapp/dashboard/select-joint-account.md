# Select Joint Account

#### **Purpose**

Selecting a joint account opens a **dedicated management workspace** focused specifically on that account. This transforms the interface into a targeted control panel where only relevant data, actions, and settings for the chosen multisig wallet are displayed.

This prevents confusion and ensures users always operate within the correct account context.

#### **Data You See**

Once a joint account is selected, the system displays detailed operational and governance information, including:

* **Account Details**\
  High-level metadata such as account identity, description, and organizational context.
* **Balance**\
  Displays available Zetrix funds and relevant token balances (where applicable).
* **Signers + Weights**\
  Shows:
  * Who the authorized signers are
  * Their assigned approval weight
  * Their governance influence
* **Threshold**\
  Indicates the minimum approval weight required before a transaction can be executed.
* **Transaction Actions**\
  Provides access to functions like:
  * Send Zetrix
  * Invoke contract
  * Submit governance proposals
  * Approve/reject pending operations
* **Governance Tools**\
  Access account modification functions such as:
  * Adding/removing signers
  * Updating weights
  * Adjusting threshold
  * Upgrading contract logic

#### **Why It Matters**

This focused workspace serves as the **command center** for that specific wallet.\
It ensures clarity, eliminates operational risk, prevents accidental actions on the wrong account, and delivers a structured environment for secure and compliant multisig management.
