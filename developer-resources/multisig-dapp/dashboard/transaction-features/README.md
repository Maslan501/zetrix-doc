**Transaction Features** provide all the tools required to perform secure operations from the multisig account, including sending Zetrix tokens, interacting with smart contracts, upgrading contract logic, and managing ownership. Every transaction follows the multisignature approval process to ensure security, transparency, and collective decision-making.
