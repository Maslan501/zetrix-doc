# Joint Account Management

**Joint Account Management** serves as the central function for handling all multisignature wallets within the Zetrix Multisig DApp. It allows users to create new multisig accounts, import existing shared wallets, convert single accounts into jointly managed accounts, and manage participants and governance policies. With structured approval mechanisms and weighted authorization, it ensures that every transaction and account update follows a secure, collective decision-making process.
