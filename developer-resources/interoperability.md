# Interoperability

Zetrix is a public blockchain that focuses on interoperability between different blockchain networks and real-world applications. It is designed to connect with other blockchains and traditional financial systems, allowing for the transfer of assets, data, and value across multiple platforms.

#### Key Features of Zetrix Interoperability:

1. **Cross-Chain Transactions**: Zetrix enables the transfer of digital assets across different blockchain networks, allowing for seamless communication between various ecosystems (e.g., Ethereum, Hyperledger).
2. **Smart Contract Integration**: It supports smart contracts that can operate across different chains, enabling developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) that interact with multiple blockchains.
3. **Real-World Integration**: Zetrix aims to bridge the gap between digital and traditional finance by integrating with real-world applications such as banking, logistics, and supply chain management. It offers a platform for enterprises to use blockchain technology without being confined to a single ecosystem.
4. **Interoperability with MYEG**: Zetrix is notably linked to Malaysiaâ€™s e-government service provider MYEG, which seeks to leverage blockchain technology such as for National Blockchain Infrastructure, cross-border transactions, and other government services.
5. **Scalability & Security**: Zetrix aims to provide scalable solutions while maintaining the high security of transactions and data sharing across different blockchains.

These features make Zetrix particularly useful for companies or developers who are looking to build multi-chain solutions or need to work in environments that require the integration of blockchain with traditional financial services and industries.
