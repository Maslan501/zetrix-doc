# Staking and Rewards

The initial total supply of **ZETRIX** tokens is set at 1 billion, with the maximum **capped at 2.1 billion.** The additional supply will be gradually released through block rewards distributed evenly to supernode validators. The table below outlines the approximate token release schedule for the initial halving cycles.

| Year | Total Mined Supply in Period (,000,000) | Cumulative Total Supply (,000,000) |
| ---- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 2022 | 1,000 \*pre-mined genesis               | 1,000                              |
| 2026 | 555                                     | 1,555                              |
| 2030 | 277                                     | 1,833                              |
| 2034 | 138                                     | 1,971                              |

Nodes are independent infrastructure groups capable of running a full Zetrix node. Operating a node requires significant hardware, bandwidth, and network stability, representing a considerable infrastructure commitment. Nodes play a critical role in sustaining the network by maintaining a full ledger of all transactions and acting as redundancies in the event of node downtime.

To qualify for block validation, each node must stake a minimum of 100,000 ZETRIX. Once operational, a node must be approved by a two-thirds majority vote from the existing Validating Nodes Committee. There is no fixed cap on the total number of approved nodes in the Zetrix network.

#### **Validator Selection and Block Rewards**

Daily, the Zetrix consensus algorithm randomly selects 21 validator nodes from the pool of approved nodes. These validator nodes are tasked with validating the next set of blocks, operating on a 10-second block interval.

Block rewards are distributed equally among all approved nodesâ€”not just the 21 validators selected per day. For example:

* Suppose there are 221 approved nodes.
* A reward of 44 ZETRIX is allocated per block.
* The reward is equally divided across all 221 approved nodes, resulting in an average of approximately 0.2 ZETRIX per node per block.

This model incentivises broader participation while ensuring decentralisation and redundancy across the network infrastructure.
