# Blockchain Layer

Zetrix is a public blockchain network that functions as a Layer-1 solution designed to support cross-border and cross-chain transactions. It focuses on creating a seamless ecosystem for decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and digital assets. Zetrix aims to bridge private and public blockchains, facilitating secure and scalable cross-chain interoperability.

Here are key aspects of Zetrix:

1. **Cross-border Compatibility**: Zetrix is designed to enable cross-border transactions, making it suitable for applications like international trade, payments, and logistics. This makes it well-suited for global business and financial transactions.
2. **Layer-1 Blockchain**: Zetrix operates as a Layer-1 blockchain, meaning it is a foundational blockchain that provides its own security, consensus, and transaction processing, without depending on other networks like Ethereum or Bitcoin for these services.
3. **Interoperability**: Zetrix supports cross-chain transactions, which means it can connect with other blockchain networks (currently ETH, Hyperledger and Astron), allowing for the transfer of assets or data between different chains.
4. **Smart Contracts**: It supports smart contracts, allowing developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) on the network. These smart contracts can be used for a variety of applications, from DeFi (Decentralized Finance) to supply chain management.
5. **Security and Scalability**: Zetrix emphasizes both security and scalability, using mechanisms like zero-knowledge proofs and cryptographic algorithms to ensure the integrity and privacy of transactions while maintaining a scalable network architecture.
6. **Partnerships and Ecosystem**: Zetrix has been working with various international partners, including collaborations with government and business entities, to promote the use of blockchain in cross-border solutions.

In summary, Zetrix is designed to be a global, interoperable, and scalable blockchain network that supports decentralized applications and secure cross-border transactions.
