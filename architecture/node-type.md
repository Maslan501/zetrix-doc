# Node Type

The Zetrix blockchain operates as a public smart contract platform targeting international markets outside of China. In partnership with the Institute of Industrial Internet and Internet of Things under the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT), MYEG is deploying Zetrix as the international extension of the Xinghuo Blockchain Infrastructure Framework (BIF). Zetrix supernodes are interconnected with Xinghuo BIF through MYEG’s overseas hosted Xinghuo supernode, facilitating inter-chain communication. This setup enables seamless interoperability between Zetrix, Xinghuo BIF, and other connected participants, supporting cross-border blockchain applications and digital infrastructure integration.

This structure allows local assets and value to be created and transacted across multiple chains, easing the flow of economic activity and improving liquidity for the assets transacted.

With Zetrix’s ready-to-use enterprise-grade infrastructure, businesses can immediately begin development without the overhead of building or configuring foundational systems. This allows organizations to allocate resources more efficiently, focusing their teams on innovating, developing, and deploying next-generation blockchain applications, rather than managing technical setup or integration complexities.
