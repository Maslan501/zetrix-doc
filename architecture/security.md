# Security

Zetrix leverages both **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)** and **Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)** as its core consensus mechanisms, each contributing to network security through distinct methodologies. DPoS emphasises governance and efficiency, allowing token holders to vote for validators who produce blocks, ensuring representation and accountability. In contrast, BFT focuses on fault tolerance, enabling the network to reach consensus even if some nodes act maliciously or fail. Together, these mechanisms provide a balanced framework that combines high performance, decentralisation, and resilience against faults or attacks.

#### DPoS: A Delegated Approach

**Consensus Mechanism:** In Zetrix’s Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, token holders assign their voting rights to a limited set of trusted representatives known as delegates. These delegates are tasked with validating transactions and proposing new blocks to the blockchain. This delegation model enhances efficiency and scalability by reducing the number of nodes directly involved in block production, while still maintaining a level of decentralisation through community-driven elections.

**Security:**

* **Accountability:** Delegating accountability is fundamental to the security of Zetrix's DPoS mechanism. Since delegates are elected by token holders, their position depends on maintaining trust and performance. Failure to fulfil responsibilities such as validating blocks reliably or acting in the network’s best interest can result in loss of voter support and removal from the validator set. This built-in incentive structure promotes honest behaviour and operational integrity among delegates, reinforcing the overall stability and trustworthiness of the network.
* **Efficiency:** By restricting consensus participation to a selected group of delegates, Zetrix’s DPoS mechanism significantly enhances network efficiency compared to traditional models like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS). This streamlined validator structure enables faster transaction finality, lowers network fees due to reduced computational overhead, and minimises energy consumption making Zetrix both performance optimised and environmentally sustainable.
* **Vulnerability:** Despite its efficiency and scalability benefits, DPoS carries inherent centralisation risks. If a majority of elected delegates collude, they could gain disproportionate control over the network, enabling potential manipulation of the blockchain. This could result in serious vulnerabilities such as transaction censorship, double-spending, or malicious protocol changes. As such, maintaining a transparent, well-governed voting process and active community oversight is critical to mitigating these risks and preserving the integrity of the Zetrix network.

#### Mitigating DPoS Vulnerabilities

To mitigate the risk of delegate collusion, DPoS systems typically implement several countermeasures, including:

* **Voting Thresholds:** Implementing a high voting threshold ensures that delegates must receive substantial backing from the community to be elected. This reduces the likelihood of a small group gaining control over the network and strengthens decentralisation.
* **Delegate Rotation:** Regular delegate rotation helps distribute authority more evenly over time, preventing power from becoming concentrated and lowering the risk of collusion among validators.
* **Community Oversight:** A proactive and informed community is essential for monitoring delegate actions and quickly identifying any signs of misconduct or abuse of power within the network.

Even with these safeguards in place, DPoS remains more centralized than consensus models like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS). This inherent centralization can increase vulnerability to coordinated attacks, particularly in networks that lack robust governance structures or an active, engaged community to provide oversight and accountability.

#### BFT: A Fault-Tolerant Approach

**Consensus Mechanism:** Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) algorithms are structured to enable a distributed network to reach consensus on a single system state, even when some nodes act maliciously or fail. By relying on majority agreement, BFT mechanisms preserve the integrity and consistency of the blockchain, making the system highly resilient to faults and external attacks.

**Security:**

* **Resilience:** BFT is highly resistant to attacks due to its fault-tolerant nature. It can tolerate a certain number of faulty nodes without compromising the system's security. This means that even if some nodes are malicious, the system can still reach consensus and maintain its integrity.
* **Complexity:** BFT algorithms can be complex to implement. They often involve intricate protocols and cryptographic techniques to achieve fault tolerance. This complexity can make it challenging to design and deploy BFT systems.
* **Performance:** BFT algorithms can have performance limitations. The frequent communication required between nodes can increase network overhead and reduce transaction throughput. This can be a concern for applications that require high performance, such as financial systems or decentralized exchanges.
