# BFT

Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) is a consensus mechanism that enables a distributed network to agree on a single data value even when some nodes are malicious or unresponsive. Its core objective is to uphold system reliability and data integrity by accommodating both honest and faulty nodes in the decision-making process. This ensures that the network maintains operational consistency and security, even under adverse conditions.

In Zetrix, nodes elected through the DPoS mechanism enter a validating set and generate blocks using a Byzantine Fault Tolerant algorithm. Unlike traditional BFT models which are constrained by communication overhead and limited validator scalability Zetrix introduces zBFT, a custom-optimized adaptation of BFT that supports a larger number of validators while preserving high performance, strong consistency, and robust security.

The zBFT algorithm includes several innovations:

* Segmented time slices for upcoming blocks, with each slice using a randomized selection of 21 validators.
* A random validator rotation mechanism that enhances network resilience and decentralization.
* An optimized quorum structure that improves liveness and responsiveness.
* A refined ViewChange protocol that reduces communication complexity from O(n²) to O(n), dramatically boosting efficiency in large-scale networks.

Together, these enhancements make zBFT a cornerstone of Zetrix’s capability to deliver enterprise-grade performance while sustaining trustless decentralization.

The zBFT algorithm in Zetrix empowers the network to achieve consensus and finality even when some validators are faulty or unresponsive. By tolerating a bounded number of node failures without undermining consensus on the blockchain state, zBFT guarantees continuous network availability and mitigates the risk of service disruptions. This level of fault resilience is vital for preserving the reliability and operational integrity of Zetrix particularly in enterprise and cross-border environments, where uptime, data consistency, and network trustworthiness are mission-critical.
