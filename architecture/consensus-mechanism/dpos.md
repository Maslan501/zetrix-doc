# DPos

Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) is a consensus algorithm designed to enhance blockchain security through a technology-driven democratic process. It relies on voting and election mechanisms to maintain decentralisation and defend against malicious activity.

\
In Zetrix, DPoS is optimised for high performance, requiring validating nodes to operate on high-specification servers within stable environments. To ensure robust network security, Zetrix implements a unique validation protocol.

* **Validator Selection**: Ordinary nodes may become validator candidates by pledging a specific amount of ZETRIX tokens. These candidates are reviewed and approved by a consensus committee.
* **Validation Pool Governance**: Approved validators enter a rotating pool. If a validator fails to produce blocks over an extended period or is found to propagate malicious consensus messages, their pledged tokens are subject to confiscation, and their validator status may be revoked.
* **On-Chain Voting Mechanism**: Validator governance is managed via smart contracts that enable a dynamic and transparent voting process. This allows the network to adjust validator participation based on the evolving needs and security parameters of the chain.

The Zetrix Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) mechanism is executed via smart contracts, allowing for automated governance and scalable adaptability as the network expands. It incorporates a dynamic upgrade system that adjusts validator participation requirements in line with network growth, thereby maintaining decentralization and performance. Unlike traditional consensus models, DPoS is highly resource-efficient, requiring minimal computational power while supporting high transaction throughput. This low-energy architecture aligns with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles, positioning Zetrix as a sustainable and future-ready blockchain infrastructure.
