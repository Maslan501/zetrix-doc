# Node Monitoring

#### **1. Introduction**

Effective node monitoring is essential for ensuring the health, performance, and security of the Zetrix blockchain network. The **Zetrix Data Screens** offer a comprehensive dashboard that enables node operators and network administrators to observe critical metrics in real time. This document details the components of the Zetrix Data Screens, explaining each metric and its role in maintaining optimal node performance and overall network integrity.

#### **2. Zetrix Data Screens Overview**

The Zetrix Data Screens provide a centralized interface for monitoring key aspects of the Zetrix blockchain. The dashboard is organized into multiple sections, displaying vital information such as network status, recent transactions, block details, node performance, and the geographical distribution of nodes.

#### **3. Utilizing Zetrix Data Screens for Node Monitoring**

Zetrix Data Screens offer an intuitive interface for monitoring various aspects of the blockchain network. Here's how to effectively utilize the Data Screens for node monitoring:

**3.1. Real-Time Monitoring**

* Action: Continuously monitor key metrics such as block height, transaction count, transactions per second (TPS), and node status.
* Benefit: Prompt detection of anomalies or performance issues enables rapid corrective action to maintain network stability.

**3.2. Custom Alerts**

* Action: Set up alerts for critical metrics (e.g., high CPU usage, node downtime, low TPS).
* Benefit: Proactive notifications help in preventing potential downtimes and maintaining network stability.

**3.3. Historical Data Analysis**

* Action: Analyze historical data to identify trends in network performance and node behavior.
* Benefit: Informs capacity planning, resource allocation, and optimization strategies.

**3.4. Geographic Insights**

* Action: Use geographic distribution data to assess network decentralization and identify regions with high node density.
* Benefit: Enhances network resilience and helps in targeting infrastructure improvements.

**3.5. Validator Node Management**

* Action: Monitor the status and performance of validator nodes to ensure active participation in consensus.
* Benefit: Maintains the integrity and security of the blockchain by ensuring that validators are consistently contributing.

The Zetrix Data Screens offer a robust suite of tools for comprehensive node monitoring, helping ensure the blockchain network remains secure, efficient, and reliable. By utilizing real-time metrics, customizable dashboards, and alerting mechanisms, node operators can maintain peak performance and support the overall integrity of the Zetrix ecosystem. Following best practices in node monitoring not only enhances network stability but also builds trust among users and stakeholders.

**4.Glossary**

* Block Height: The number of blocks in the blockchain preceding a particular block.
* TPS (Transactions Per Second): A measure of how many transactions a blockchain network can process each second.
* Validator Node: A node responsible for validating transactions and maintaining the consensus mechanism in the blockchain.
* Sync Node: A node that synchronizes the blockchain data with other nodes to ensure consistency across the network.
* DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service): An attack where multiple compromised systems attack a target, causing a denial of service.
